# Coding Problems

This folder has a collection of interesting problems that I have solved. The problems are from LeetCode website. The order and naming convention of those problems are the same from LeetCode.com. The version number at the end of the the name indicates the number of the solutions I had and they are in time order (ie. I initially solved the problem and put code in v1.py, then if I found another solution, I will code it in v2.py).

## 1. Two Sum
- Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
